        <h2 >Gardening Tips</h2>
        <section class="tile is-child box">
        <h3>Soil type</h3>
        <p>Soil is different depending on region, the type of soil can change the speed the water drains and the stability of your plants. 
        There can also be contaminants in your soil and/or the ph level can be inhospitable to what is planted. Testing the soil in your area is one of the first recommended steps in your gardening journey.

        <section class="tile is-child is-vertical box">
        <h3>Hardiness zone</h3>
        <p>The hardiness zone is how resilient a plant must be to survive in a region. 
            The zones are represented by a number, plants will do well in regions with their associated numbers. 
        </p>

        <h3>Sunlight</h3>
        <p>Afternoon sunlight is harsher than morning. If you cannot place your garden in an ideal location that increases the morning light while reducing the afternoon sun. 
            The harshness of direct sunlight can be reduced with a screen, pergola, or a lattice wall. 
            plant height can change the amount of sun your plants are exposed to so be mindful of the placement in your garden
        </p>
    </section>
       <section class="tile is-child box">
    <h3>Cross Pollination</h3>
        <p>Cross pollination can occur when plants of the same species are placed together, it can create undesired outcomes when growing foods. 
            It is recommended that plants of similar species are separated to reduce the chances of this happening.
        </p>
    </section> 
    <section class="tile is-child box">
        <h3>Watering</h3>
        <p>There are multiple ways to water plants like drip systems or just with a hose. 
            It is recommended to water your plants within the guidelines of your local community. 
            If your area doesn't have watering restrictions then it is recommended to water in the morning between 5-9 or in the afternoon between the same hours. 
            Watering in the morning is most preferred as it gives the soil time to dry.
        </p>

        <h3>Alternative ways to garden</h3>
        <p>If your area isn't suitable for traditional methods there are other ways to grow plants. 
            Raised beds are a way to lift your plants off of the ground and give them suitable soil conditions, it increases the soil’s exposure to temperature changes and may change the watering requirements.  
            Planters are another way to grow your plants but the space available for plant growth may cause issues.
